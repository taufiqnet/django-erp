### **Delivery Model**

#### **1. Delivery Zones**
Define delivery zones to calculate delivery times and fees based on the location:
- **Local Zone**: Same city or area.
- **National Zone**: Across cities or regions in the same country.
- **International Zone**: Outside the country (if applicable).

#### **2. Delivery Options**
Offer multiple delivery options to cater to different customer needs:
- **Standard Delivery**: Cost-effective and takes 3–7 business days.
- **Express Delivery**: Faster but at a higher cost, taking 1–2 business days.
- **Same-Day Delivery**: For local areas, deliver within the same day.
- **Scheduled Delivery**: Customers select a specific date and time.

#### **3. Delivery Charges**
Calculate delivery fees dynamically based on:
- **Order Value**: Free delivery above a threshold (e.g., ৳900).
- **Delivery Zone**: Charges increase for distant zones.
- **Weight and Size**: Heavier or larger packages cost more.
- **Special Handling**: Fragile or perishable items incur additional fees.

#### **4. Tracking System**
Provide real-time tracking for customers:
- Order Status: Placed → Packed → Shipped → Out for Delivery → Delivered.
- Live Map Tracking: For same-day or express delivery services.

#### **5. Partnered Logistics**
Work with logistics providers to ensure smooth delivery:
- **Local Couriers**: For fast and flexible local deliveries.
- **National Logistics**: Partner with established courier services for broader reach.
- **International Carriers**: Use companies like FedEx, DHL, or UPS for global orders.

#### **6. Delivery Personnel Workflow**
Create a clear workflow for delivery personnel:
1. **Receive Pickup Request**: Collect items from the warehouse/store.
2. **Route Optimization**: Use software to calculate the most efficient delivery route.
3. **Delivery Attempt**: Ensure at least 2 attempts for undelivered orders.
4. **Customer Feedback**: Collect feedback after successful delivery.

#### **7. Return and Exchange**
Set a clear policy for returns:
- Free pickup for returns within a specified period.
- Refund or exchange processing after inspection of returned items.

#### **8. Notifications**
Keep customers informed at every stage:
- Order Confirmation: Email and SMS with estimated delivery date.
- Dispatch Notification: Tracking link with carrier details.
- Out for Delivery: Delivery personnel contact info.
- Delivery Confirmation: Digital proof of delivery (photo or signature).

#### **9. Emergency Handling**
Plan for contingencies:
- Failed Delivery: Notify the customer and reschedule.
- Address Issues: Contact the customer to verify or update the address.
- Damaged Items: Offer quick replacement or refund for damaged goods.

#### **10. Reporting and Analytics**
Use data to improve efficiency:
- Average delivery time per zone.
- Percentage of successful deliveries on the first attempt.
- Customer satisfaction ratings for delivery services.
